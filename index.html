<h1 class="gingerbread">The Indigo Demesne</h1>
<ul>
  <li>The lady of the land never had children but always wanted them</li>
  <li>She collected dolls instead for several years</li>
  <li>Her desperation to have children grew and drove her to make deals with a coven of witches</li>
  <li>The black magic warped the land and the lord grew sick</li>
  <li>Instead of being able to bear children, her dolls came to life and were twisted and evil</li>
  <li>The lady sunk into madness and believed her dolls were her children even as they did terrible things</li>
  <li>The lady had servants executed for the slightest faults requiring the graveyard to be constructed</li>
</ul>
