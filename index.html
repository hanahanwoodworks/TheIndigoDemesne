<h1>The Indigo Demesne</h1>


<ul>
  <li>Ancient, historic house owned by a lord</li>
  <li>The lady of the land never had children but always wanted them</li>
  <li>She collected dolls instead</li>
  <li>She met with witches to try to make her conceive with a child</li>
  <li>The black magic warped the land and the lord grew sick</li>
  <li>Instead of being able to bear children, her dolls came to life and were all twisted</li>
  <li>The lady sunk into madness, believing her dolls were her children even as they did terrible things</li>
  <li>The lady had servants executed for the slightest faults requiring the graveyard to be constructed</li>
  <li>Most of the lands of the house are now filled with graves, spiders, and a coven of witches that the lady dealt with</li>
  <li>The house itself is haunted by the spirits of the deceased servants</li>
</ul>
